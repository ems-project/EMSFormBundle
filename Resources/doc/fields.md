## Fields

### Checkbox <a name="checkbox"/>

### Choice Radios <a name="choiceradios"/>

### Choice Select <a name="choiceselect"/>

### Choice Select Multiple <a name="choiceselectmultiple"/>
A list of values that can be chosen from using a select box. The end user is allowed to choose multiple values.

### Date <a name="date"/>
A single text to enter a date with a defined format : dd/mm/yyyy and save as string.

### DateWithPicker <a name="datewithpicker"/>
A single text to enter a date with a defined format : dd/mm/yyyy and save as string.
A custom class : 'date-with-picker' is available and can be used by your frontend to activate and style the datepicker plugin of your choice.
The css and javascript for this datepicker are the responsability of the site that integrates the form, as there are too much options for the different frameworks out there.

### Email <a name="email"/>
Ensure that the end user's input is a valid email address.

### Email With Confirmation <a name="emailwithconfirmation"/>
Ensure that the end user's input is a valid email address. And provides a second field in which the end user needs to validate the given address.
This field is designed to prevent pasting values in both the original and repeated email field.

### File <a name="file"/>
Allow an end user to upload a file.

### Number <a name="number"/>
This field only allows integers as input.

### Phone <a name="phone"/>
A field that's used for phone input, as per html standard no validations happen by default on this field.

### Text <a name="text"/>
A simple field for text input (one line).

### Textarea <a name="textarea"/>
A simple field for large text input (multiple lines).

### Time <a name="time"/>
A field to define a time with a text input with format HH:mm.

### Markup <a name="markup"/>
This field is special, as it is not a real form field. The `Markup` field allows you to introduce text between fields in your form.
The end user cannot change the value of this field, and the static data of this 'field' is not processed on submit.

### NissInsz <a name="nissinsz"/>
A text field designed to combine with the NissInsz validation. The frontend will automatically activate validation when both this field and it's validation are combined.

### Submit <a name="submit"/>
Make sure to add this field at the end of your form to allow the submission of your data to the server!

## Why are we defining custom fields for our validations that can operate on the Text field type ?
You might notice that we develop fields like "niss-insz" that only diverge from the Text field in the id they provide. ('niss-insz' in this case).
We use this to have a link between our form field class in the HTML code and the class used by our Javascript to automatically instantiate javascript validation.
